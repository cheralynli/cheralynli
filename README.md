## Hi there! I'm Cheralyn
**🍄About me**

I'm a first-year datsci student in HKU curious about the world of code.
My journey here is currently working on cool projects starting from "Hello World" to building productivity apps.

I'm interested in learning about how front-end development works and how I can implement it in presenting data-driven insights.

**✨What's next?**


I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussing data science, web development, and everything in between!
