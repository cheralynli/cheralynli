## Hi there! I'm Cher
**🍄About me**

I'm a first-year datsci student in HKU curious about the world of code.
My journey here is currently working on cool projects starting from "Hello World" to building productivity apps and exploring software development tools.

I'm interested in learning about how full-stack development works and how I can implement it in presenting data-driven insights.

**✨Looking forward**


I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussing about data science, app/web development, and everything in between!
